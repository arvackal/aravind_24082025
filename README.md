Ideas for Improvements

1. Excel Output
   Generating reports in Excel format (.xlsx) can provide better structure, formatting, and usability compared to
   CSV, making the data easier to analyze.

2. Frontend Dashboard
   A user-friendly frontend UI with charts, bar graphs, and tables can help visualize uptime/downtime trends more
   effectively, providing quick insights at a glance.
